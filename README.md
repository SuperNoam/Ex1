# Ex1 assigment
## General Overview 
This assigment focus on the foundations of function programming and testing.
The assigment was to build a basic clalcuator and base convertor for positive numbers.
### Details
* The first thing the program doing is asking the user for input of 2 number
in the format of (num)b(base) where the number can be built from digits of
0-9 and letters of A-G,
* The base can also be one of the digits 2-9 or one of the letters A-G.
* For each number the programe will test if the input fits into the format and
ask the user to enter again if not.
* If the input is in the correct format the program will say it and will display 
the value of the number in base 10 for easy understanding.

<br />

* After the user has entered 2 numbers which is in the correct format it will ask
the user for a base for the following calculations.
* The program will add the numbers and display the output in the given base.
* Also the program will display the mutliplication of numbers in the given base.
* And then the program will output the max number between the numbers, the sum and the multiplication of them.

# infinite loop
The program run in an infinite loop which let the user to continue input numbers until he want to stop which then he enter "quit"
which stop the program
